# WarmUp_Projects
Projects based on assignments from the book Exercises For Programmers

For each problem there are two versions, a version written in java and another version written in swift.
My goals for working through the book are to get better and cleaner code.  
If any of these projects help someone else achieve their coding goals, give them a launching point, idea, then that is wonderful.
